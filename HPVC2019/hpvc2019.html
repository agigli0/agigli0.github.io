      I helped lead the Harvard College Human Powered Vehicle Team (HPVT) to its first <a href="https://www.asme.org/conferences-events/competitions/human-powered-vehicle-challenge-(hpvc)">American Society of Mechanical Engineers Human Powered Vehicle Challenge</a> (HPVC) at ASME E-Fest North at Michigan State University in April of 2019. We placed 35th out of 50 teams. The bike above, Crimson Chili, was our vehicle.

      2017-2018: The year we don't talk about
    </h2>
    <p>
      I helped start the HPVT back in fall of 2017. Our mission was to design and fabricate a new human-powered vehicle each year to compete in HPVC. The project is a way for Harvard engineering undergraduates to learn hands-on engineering and teamwork skills that are not covered in classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 2017-2018 academic year, my sophomore year, we did not finish our recumbent tricycle, Crimson Cruiser, in time for competition in April 2018. We presented a half-finished vehicle at the spring design fair <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/05/making-pedals-out-of-metal"> and got a nice article written about us</a>.

      <em>Crimson Cruiser, last year's incomplete vehicle</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      We failed to complete the vehicle in team because of poor planning and a lack of knowledge. We were a bunch of sophomore engineering students making things up as they went along, and the lack of experience showed. We didn't start fabrication until about a month before competition, and we didn't have our frame finished with a week left to competition. I spent more time working on the vehicle than going to class or doing homework in March 2018: rushing to piece together a viable CAD, cutting metal, making welding fixtures, buying parts at the last minute. All that hard, stupid work, and we had a crappy frame with some fancy wheels barely hanging on, and we had to keep it in the basement because it wasn't finished.
    <p>
      So yeah, that stunk. I promised myself that I would go to competition with a vehicle in 2019. And I did!

    <h2>Things I'm Proud of</h2>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      At the start of the school year, I implemented the policy of keeping track of everything in a collaborative design journal using Google Docs. Any time any member did anything related to the club &mdash; CAD design, simulation, internet research, physical experiments, rapid prototyping &mdash; they had to include a short report about it in the design journal with a picture.
    </p>
    <img width=100% src="journal_grid_1.jpg">
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <em>16 pages from our 213-page design journal</em>
    </div>
    <p>
      This was helpful for two reasons. The first was that it made writing our design report for the competition much easier. The second was that it helped members who missed a meeting stay in the loop.
    </p>
    <h3>Ergonomics Rig</h3>
    <p>
      To make sure every rider could fit comfortably in the vehicle, I designed and assembled an adjustable seat rig out of <a href="https://8020.net">80/20 brand</a> brand t-slot aluminum extrusion for fit checks. It was also helpful for making sure that whatever rollover protection system (RPS) we designed adequately protected us.
    </p>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">

        <img width=100% src="ergo_rig.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      Above is me sitting in the rig looking like a goof for the sake of science and good engineering practice. I made sure to include a ruler for scale in the image so that I could overlay a translucent version of the image on top of any designs we made in SolidWorks.
    </p>
    <h2>Frame</h2>
    <p>
      The frame was my baby and my favorite part of the vehicle to design. We used 4130 chromoly steel because it is very strong strong and easy to weld compared to aluminum. We considered doing a composite frame, but I didn't feel comfortable doing a full rollover in my first carbon fiber frame ever. It's expensive, but it's cheaper than carbon fiber, we had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_endowment">Harvard's money</a> to work with. 
    </p>

    </div>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <em>The bare frame after welding (plus a few subcomponents)</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      I designed the frame using SolidWorks. SolidWorks has nice tools for quickly making vehicle frames and performing quick simulations on long thin members. I went through about ten major iterations of the frame design, six of which are below.
