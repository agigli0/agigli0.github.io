      I helped start the Harvard College Human Powered Vehicle Team (HPVT) back in fall of 2017. Our mission was to design and fabricate a new human-powered vehicle each year to compete in the <a href="https://www.asme.org/conferences-events/competitions/human-powered-vehicle-challenge-(hpvc)">American Society of Mechanical Engineers Human Powered Vehicle Challenge</a> (HPVC). The project is a way for Harvard engineering undergraduates to learn hands-on engineering and teamwork skills that are not covered in classes.

      In the 2017-2018 academic year, my sophomore year, we did not finish our recumbent tricycle, Crimson Cruiser, in time for competition. We presented a half-finished vehicle at the spring design fair <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/05/making-pedals-out-of-metal"> and got a nice article written about us</a>.

      Failing to finish something that you promised yourself you would finish is a terrible feeling. Determined not to feel that way again, I went into my junior year completely certain that we would compete in 2019. I was elected vice president of the club over the summer of 2018 and promoted to president at the beginning of 2019.
