    <h1>ES120: Teaching Fellow</h1>
    <p>
      In spring of 2019, I was a teaching fellow for ES120: Introduction to Solid Mechanics under the leadership of <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/bertoldi">Professor Katia Bertoldi</a> and with teaching fellows <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-rmf/">Andrea Rodriguez-Marin Freudmann</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mélançon-4b9ba2103/">David Melan&ccedilon</a>. My responsibilities included grading assignments, organizing labs, holding office hours, teaching problem-solving sessions, and writing exam problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because statics is not taught as a separate course at Harvard, some students had trouble understanding the concept of two-force members. I wrote explanations and examples for students who couldn't make it to my office hours.

    </div>
    <p>
      For problem-solving sections, I wrote my own problems to address conceptual difficulties that students made clear during lectures or in their problem sets. I made my own detailed graphics in LaTeX and wrote full solutions.

      For exams, we wrote problems that had multiple parts, the first parts testing for competence and the later ones testing for proficiency.

      Teaching was a lot of fun and a great learning experience. It was rewarding to see students overcome obstacles that held myself back at some point.
