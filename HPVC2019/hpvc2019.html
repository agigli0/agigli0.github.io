      I helped lead the Harvard College Human Powered Vehicle Team (HPVT) to its first <a href="https://www.asme.org/conferences-events/competitions/human-powered-vehicle-challenge-(hpvc)">American Society of Mechanical Engineers Human Powered Vehicle Challenge</a> (HPVC) at ASME E-Fest North at Michigan State University in April of 2019. We placed 35th out of 50 teams. The bike above, Crimson Chili, was our vehicle.
    </p>

    <h2>
      2017-2018: The year we don't talk about
    </h2>
    <p>
      I helped start the HPVT back in fall of 2017. Our mission was to design and fabricate a new human-powered vehicle each year to compete in HPVC. The project is a way for Harvard engineering undergraduates to learn hands-on engineering and teamwork skills that are not covered in classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 2017-2018 academic year, my sophomore year, we did not finish our recumbent tricycle, Crimson Cruiser, in time for competition in April 2018. We presented a half-finished vehicle at the spring design fair <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/05/making-pedals-out-of-metal"> and got a nice article written about us</a>.

      <em>Crimson Cruiser, last year's incomplete vehicle</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      We failed to complete the vehicle in team because of poor planning and a lack of knowledge. We were a bunch of sophomore engineering students making things up as they went along, and the lack of experience showed. We didn't start fabrication until about a month before competition, and we didn't have our frame finished with a week left to competition. I spent more time working on the vehicle than going to class or doing homework in March 2018: rushing to piece together a viable CAD, cutting metal, making welding fixtures, buying parts at the last minute. All that hard, stupid work, and we had a crappy frame with some fancy wheels barely hanging on, and we had to keep it in the basement because it wasn't finished.
    <p>
      So yeah, that stunk. I promised myself that I would go to competition with a vehicle in 2019. And I did!
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>2018-2019: Things that I'm proud of</h2>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      At the start of the school year, I implemented the policy of keeping track of everything in a collaborative design journal using Google Docs. Any time any member did anything related to the club &mdash; CAD design, simulation, internet research, physical experiments, rapid prototyping &mdash; they had to include a short report about it in the design journal with a picture.
    </p>
    <img width=100% src="journal_grid_1.jpg">
    <div class="text-center">
      <em>16 pages from our 213-page design journal</em>
    </div>
    <p>
      This was helpful for two reasons. The first was that it made writing our design report for the competition much easier. The second was that it helped members who missed a meeting stay in the loop.
    </p>
    <h3>Ergonomics Rig</h3>
    <p>
      To make sure every rider could fit comfortably in the vehicle, I designed and assembled an adjustable seat rig out of <a href="https://8020.net">80/20 brand</a> brand t-slot aluminum extrusion for fit checks. It was also helpful for making sure that whatever rollover protection system (RPS) we designed adequately protected us.
    </p>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="col-lg-10">
        <img width=100% src="ergo_rig.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      Above is me sitting in the rig looking like a goof for the sake of science and good engineering practice. I made sure to include a ruler for scale in the image so that I could overlay a translucent version of the image on top of any designs we made in SolidWorks.
    </p>
    <h3>Frame</h3>
    <p>
      The frame was my baby and my favorite part of the vehicle to design. We used 4130 chromoly steel because it is very strong strong and easy to weld compared to aluminum. We considered doing a composite frame, but I didn't feel comfortable doing a full rollover in my first carbon fiber frame ever. It's expensive, but it's cheaper than carbon fiber, we had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_endowment">Harvard's money</a> to work with. 
    </p>

    <div class="text-center">
      <em>The bare frame after welding (plus a few subcomponents)</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      I designed the frame using SolidWorks. SolidWorks has nice tools for quickly making vehicle frames and performing fast finite element analysis on long thin members. I went through about ten major iterations of the frame design, six of which are below.

    <p>
    	I used the SolidWorks Simulation package to perform static solid mechanical finite element analysis and make sure that the final frame would be strong enough with a factor of safety of 5.
    </p>
    <p>
    	To ensure accurate tube notching with minimal training on new equipment, I developed a workflow for creating printable paper templates that could be wrapped around the metal tubes. To hold the tubes in place during welding, we drew inspiration from the University of Pittsburgh Human Powered Vehicle Club and made two laser-cut MDF jigs.

    <br>
    The first iteration of the jig was designed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainy-michelsen-502193151/">Rainy Michelsen</a>. I developed the final iteration by removing as much material as possible to minimize the weight. I brough the weight of the MDF parts down from about 100 pounds to about 40 pounds. We MIG welded the frame because of the shorter learning time compared to that of TIG welding. Generally, TIG welding is recommended for thin-walled chromoly tubes because it allows for greater heat control and maintains the strength of the alloy better. We plan to learn TIG for the 2019-2020 academic year.

      <em>A hand-machined rear dropout</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    I machined the rear dropouts, the part of the bike that holds a wheel in place, from some 1/4" angle stock. Because the tolerances are pretty loose for dropouts, I was able to machine these with a drill press, hack saw, and file instead of on a mill. I then turned a dummy rear axle from some aluminum round stock to hold the dropouts in place during welding and ensure proper dropout spacing for the rear wheel.

    	To accomdate riders of different sizes, certain parts of the vehicle needed to be adjustable. We elected to keep the all riders' hips in the same place to keep the distance from the riders' hands to the handlebars constant. As a result, the upper back support and pedals needed to be adjustable. To allow for an adjustable upper back support, Terrance Williams designed this elegant aluminum part, which I then machined. It used a spring-loaded detent pin to hold its position.

    <h3>Adjustable bottom bracket</h3>

    <p>
    	To allow the pedals to be adjustable, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-rmf/">Andrea Rodriguez-Marin Freudmann</a> designed an adjustable bottom bracket shell that clamped onto the front of the bike with a cam-handle screw. I helped machine parts for this assembly.
