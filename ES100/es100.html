      Process for Optimizing Optical Coupling between Fibers and Photonic Integrated Circuits
    </h1>

        <a href="Process for Optimizing Optical Coupling between Fibers and Photonic Integrated Circuits.pdf"> My senior capstone project/senior design project/senior thesis/thing I needed to do to get an ABET-accredited degree from Harvard College</a> was about threading a micron-sized needle with light. I won an honorable mention for the Dean's Award for Outstanding Engineering Project in Mechanical Engineering.

        The trick to look like you're doing science is to have as much Thorlabs equipment in the shot as possible.

        I had the privilege of working with <a href="https://nano-optics.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard's Laboratory for Nanoscale Optics</a>. They wanted to improve the efficiency with which they could send light from an optical fiber to a photonic integrated circuit. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are semiconductor nanostructures that manipulate light at the wave level. They are the optical analog to electronic integrated circuits like the microprocessor inside the computer you're using the read this. PICs are made using photolithography much like electronic integrated circuits because that's the only way to make structures with sizes near the wavelength of infrared light.

        If your PIC is designed to manipulate single photons, then it's a quantum optic device.

        Quantum optics are incredibly sensitive to insertion losses. If you can't ensure that almost all the light from the optical fiber is reaching the right parts of the PIC, the device will not work. My thesis was concerned with developing a process for automatically aligning optical fibers with PICs within 500 nm of the optimal position and then mechanically fastening the fiber to the PIC.

        A very special thanks to my advisor, Eric Puma, my thesis reader, Marko Lon&ccaron;ar, and my section leader, Christopher Lombardo. An even more special thanks goes out to my friends in engineering and at school.
