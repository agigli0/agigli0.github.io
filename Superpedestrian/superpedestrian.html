      Superpedestrian Summer
    </h1>
    <p>
      In the summer of 2018, after my sophomore year, I did a mechanical engineering internship at Cambridge startup <a href="https://superpedestrian.com">Superpedestrian</a>. They're most well-known for the Copenhagen Wheel, an complete e-bike conversion kit contained completely inside a wheel.

      When I started work, the company hadn't made a full, public committment to the share scooter space, so about half of the work that I did was continuing engineering on the Cophenhagen Wheel. The other half of the work I did was designing and prototyping lock solutions for a concept dockless sharebike.

      Spoke tension measurement using sound.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I did a number of projects and testing for the Copenhagen Wheel. The one that I enjoyed the most was acoustic spoke tension measurement. Unlike a normal bike wheel with spokes that cross over each other, the spokes of a Copenhagen wheel are uninterrupted spans between the hub and the rim.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that they vibrate quite nicely and make a very clear sound when plucked. I was tasked with creating a procedure for determing spoke tension using sound so that riders could do maintenance on their own wheels without needing an expensive hand tension meter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing I did was decide on an appropriate physical model. Initially, I treated the spokes as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_vibration#Frequency_of_the_wave">strings under tension</a>, but this proved to be a poor approximation because a spoke under standard tension has too much resistance to bending. On the other hand, I couldn't use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerâ€“Bernoulli_beam_theory#Example:_unsupported_(free-free)_beam">standard beam vibration formulae</a> because the beam was under axial tension. Luckily, the good folks at NASA developed <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760006440.pdf">a model for the vibration of beams under axial load</a> back in the '70s. The equation I derived with their help gives a formula that is a hybrid of the beam and string equations.

      <em>L</em> is spoke length, <em>E</em> is elastic modulus, <em>I</em> is second moment of area, mu is linear mass density, and <em>T</em> is tension force.

    <h2>
      Dockless sharebike locking
    </h2>
      <p>
        If you make a dockless sharebike or share scooter like <a href="https://www.li.me">Lime</a> or <a href="https://jump.com">Jump</a> or now Superpedestrian, you probably want a way for customers to lock their vehicle to a streetpost so that it doesn't end up on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/birdgraveyard/">@birdgraveyard</a>. Superpedestrian's current micromobility platform has a built-in cable lock similar to the one that I was tasked to prototype for a bike system.
      </p>

        I took a stroll around Cambridge to document how people locked their bikes onto things on the street. I analyzed the market for existing bike lock solutions, including those not tailored for sharebikes. I brainstormed a number of solutions on paper first and then in CAD.

        I did a design review with the engineering team and got the go-ahead to begin prototyping a retractable cable lock system. The first prototype was a 1-hour proof-of-concept made from a wire conduit, some flat washers, a rope, and a bolt. The later ones were made from PVC pipe and deconstructed off-the-shelf cable locks. The final one was made from machined and 3D-printed parts, and had an Arduino-controlled lock mechanism taken from an off-the-shelf horseshoe lock.
