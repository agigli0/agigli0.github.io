    <h1>ES123: Science of Splashback</h1>
    <p>
        This is a video about urine and why it gets everywhere. I made it for two reasons. First, I needed a final project subject for Engineering Sciences 123: Introduction to Fluid Mechanics and Transport Processes, and the fluid mechanics phenomena involved in droplet formation are fascinating. Second, I wanted to make my five-year-old self proud that his future self made pee jokes at school.

        I worked with another mechanical engineering concentrator, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-m-235250104">Andrew Meersand</a>. Our professor, <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/shmuel">Shmuel Rubenstein</a>, was excited about the potential of the internet to educate and rise of scientific education programs on YouTube. He decided that the format of the final project for ES123 would be an educational video.

        We had help from Nicole Sharp of <a href="http://fyfluiddynamics.com">FYFD</a> and <a href="https://splashlab.org/people/">Randy Hurd</a> of Utah State University's SplashLab.
