      I helped lead the Harvard College Human Powered Vehicle Team (HPVT) to its first <a href="https://www.asme.org/conferences-events/competitions/human-powered-vehicle-challenge-(hpvc)">American Society of Mechanical Engineers Human Powered Vehicle Challenge</a> (HPVC) at ASME E-Fest North at Michigan State University in April of 2019. We placed 35th out of 50 teams. The bike above, Crimson Chili, was our vehicle.
    </p>

    <h2>
      2017-2018: The year we don't talk about
    </h2>
    <p>
      I helped start the HPVT back in fall of 2017. Our mission was to design and fabricate a new human-powered vehicle each year to compete in HPVC. The project is a way for Harvard engineering undergraduates to learn hands-on engineering and teamwork skills that are not covered in classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 2017-2018 academic year, my sophomore year, we did not finish our recumbent tricycle, Crimson Cruiser, in time for competition in April 2018. We presented a half-finished vehicle at the spring design fair <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2018/05/making-pedals-out-of-metal"> and got a nice article written about us</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="text-center">
      <em>Crimson Cruiser, last year's incomplete vehicle</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      We failed to complete the vehicle in team because of poor planning and a lack of knowledge. We were a bunch of sophomore engineering students making things up as they went along, and the lack of experience showed. We didn't start fabrication until about a month before competition, and we didn't have our frame finished with a week left to competition. I spent more time working on the vehicle than going to class or doing homework in March 2018: rushing to piece together a viable CAD, cutting metal, making welding fixtures, buying parts at the last minute. All that hard, stupid work, and we had a crappy frame with some fancy wheels barely hanging on, and we had to keep it in the basement because it wasn't finished.
    <p>
      So yeah, that stunk. I promised myself that I would go to competition with a vehicle in 2019. And I did!
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>2018-2019: Things that I'm proud of</h2>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      At the start of the school year, I implemented the policy of keeping track of everything in a collaborative design journal using Google Docs. Any time any member did anything related to the club &mdash; CAD design, simulation, internet research, physical experiments, rapid prototyping &mdash; they had to include a short report about it in the design journal with a picture.
    </p>
    <img width=100% src="journal_grid_1.jpg">
    <div class="text-center">
      <em>16 pages from our 213-page design journal</em>
    </div>
    <p>
      This was helpful for two reasons. The first was that it made writing our design report for the competition much easier. The second was that it helped members who missed a meeting stay in the loop.
    </p>
    <h3>Ergonomics Rig</h3>
    <p>
      To make sure every rider could fit comfortably in the vehicle, I designed and assembled an adjustable seat rig out of <a href="https://8020.net">80/20 brand</a> brand t-slot aluminum extrusion for fit checks. It was also helpful for making sure that whatever rollover protection system (RPS) we designed adequately protected us.
    </p>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">
      <div class="col-lg-10">
        <img width=100% src="ergo_rig.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      Above is me sitting in the rig looking like a goof for the sake of science and good engineering practice. I made sure to include a ruler for scale in the image so that I could overlay a translucent version of the image on top of any designs we made in SolidWorks.
    </p>
    <h3>Frame</h3>
    <p>
      The frame was my baby and my favorite part of the vehicle to design. We used 4130 chromoly steel because it is very strong strong and easy to weld compared to aluminum. We considered doing a composite frame, but I didn't feel comfortable doing a full rollover in my first carbon fiber frame ever. It's expensive, but it's cheaper than carbon fiber, we had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_endowment">Harvard's money</a> to work with. 
    </p>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">

    <div class="text-center">
      <em>The bare frame after welding (plus a few subcomponents)</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      I designed the frame using SolidWorks. SolidWorks has nice tools for quickly making vehicle frames and performing fast finite element analysis on long thin members. I went through about ten major iterations of the frame design, six of which are below.

    	I used the SolidWorks Simulation package to perform static solid mechanical finite element analysis and make sure that the final frame would be strong enough with a factor of safety of 5.
    </p>
    <p>
    	To ensure accurate tube notching with minimal training on new equipment, I developed a workflow for creating printable paper templates that could be wrapped around the metal tubes. To hold the tubes in place during welding, we drew inspiration from the University of Pittsburgh Human Powered Vehicle Club and made two laser-cut MDF jigs.

    <br>
    The first iteration of the jig was designed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainy-michelsen-502193151/">Rainy Michelsen</a>. I developed the final iteration by removing as much material as possible to minimize the weight. I brough the weight of the MDF parts down from about 100 pounds to about 40 pounds. We MIG welded the frame because of the shorter learning time compared to that of TIG welding. Generally, TIG welding is recommended for thin-walled chromoly tubes because it allows for greater heat control and maintains the strength of the alloy better. We plan to learn TIG for the 2019-2020 academic year.

    </div>
    <br>
    I machined the rear dropouts, the part of the bike that holds a wheel in place, from some 1/4" angle stock. Because the tolerances are pretty loose for dropouts, I was able to machine these with a drill press, hack saw, and file instead of on a mill. I then turned a dummy rear axle from some aluminum round stock to hold the dropouts in place during welding and ensure proper dropout spacing for the rear wheel.

    	To accomdate riders of different sizes, certain parts of the vehicle needed to be adjustable. We elected to keep the all riders' hips in the same place to keep the distance from the riders' hands to the handlebars constant. As a result, the upper back support and pedals needed to be adjustable. To allow for an adjustable upper back support, Terrance Williams designed this elegant aluminum part, which I then machined. It used a spring-loaded detent pin to hold its position.

      <em>Whipping around a corner in the endurance event</em>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      While it was immensely satisfying to finally compete and do reasonably well for our first year, there are some very clear places for improvement.
    </p>
    <h3>Safety</h3>
    <p>
      HPVC requires a roll protection system (RPS) for recumbent vehicles. Recumbent vehicles, like ours, have the advantage of a smaller cross-sectional area and thus less air resistance. They pose the risk, however, of trapping the rider underneath them in a full rollover. Our RPS was passable; it would have stopped us from dying in a full rollover because it protected our head, neck, and vital organs, but our limbs were definitely at risk if we didn't fall in the exact right position. A goal for next year is to make an RPS that stops the rider from touching the ground at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, our seat was a mess because we designed it at the last minute. Plywood is a totally viable building material, but we didn't test it well enough to verify that our use of it was safe. We also didn't make sure that our seatbelt system would hold us in place during a crash, and we had to modify the system on-site to keep us from falling off the bike when we tipped over. A goal for next year is to design the seat to better keep the rider in place during a rollover, possibly by integrating lateral supports into the frame itself.
    </p>
    <h3>Stability</h3>
    <p>
      HPVC puts standard recumbent bikes like Chili at a disadvantage in the endurance competition because of the frequent starts and stops required. Recumbents bikes are inherently harder to balance and start from a dead stop because of the lack of bodyweight for leverage like on an upright bike. We might consider building a trike next year to account for this. On the other hand, Chili was super nimble compared to a lot of the recumbent tricycles because of its short wheelbase and ability to lean into turns.
    </p>
    <h3>Drivetrain efficiency</h3>
    <p>
      Adjustable pedals are a wonderful thing, but you need to have a system that accounts for the change in effective chain length that comes about when you're moving a crankset back and forth. We threw together one at the last minute, but it wasn't strong enough for the high forces in the chain, caused a lot of rubbing and friction, and wasn't easily-adjustable enough to be useful. Next year, we need to have a chain management system that is both low-friction and adjustable from a single point.
    </p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous half-assery</h3>
    <p>
      There are a lot of parts on the bike that are very bad because we designed them at the last minute and were falling apart. They were half-assed. These include
      <ul>
        <li>The duct-tape on corners of the frame to protect people from sharp edges</li>
        <li>The floppy plastic flags on the back of the frame that held our school log</li>
        <li>The taped-on rear-view mirror</li>
        <li>The lack of a brake on the rear wheel</li>
        <li>The spandex sack we used for cargo storage instead of designing or buying a solid cargo rack</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Leadership and New Member Retention</h3>
    <p>
      This year was my first time leading an engineering team, and I goofed in a lot of ways. One mistake I made was trying to teach every member, including new freshmen, everything that I knew in the first month of the club. This led to me boring the heck out of new members and losing all of them by week six. In internships, my bosses never made me sit through hours of lectures; they gave me assignments, and if I didn't have the skills to complete them, then they would teach me what I needed to know. I plan on using that strategy with new members next year. I've also found that engineers work really well in pairs, where they have the opportunity to bounce ideas off each other but don't feel like they can't participate. I think that I'll have new members work in pairs with each other and report to a senior officer as they need to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did a poor job of creating and sticking to a long-term engineering schedule. I didn't communicate my long-term vision for the design process to other members, and I should have been more clear about what I anticipated would be the next steps for the team at every checkpoint. One goal I'm setting for next year is to have at the very least the next three weeks planned out day-for-day at any point in the school year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I was afraid of handing responsibilities off to other people. I took so much responsiblity on myself that it was hard to manage the team. I'm fairly confident in my abilities as an engineering student, but I know that I will get very quickly outworked by a team of average performers working well together. Next year, I'll just have to be more trusting.
    </p>
    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      If you've made it this far, thank you for listening to my ramblings. HPVT is by far my favorite thing that I do at Harvard, and I pour my heart and soul into this club. I have one last year to get things right, and I'm looking for a top ten finish in my senior year.
