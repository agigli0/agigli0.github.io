			The final project in Harvard's Engineering Sciences 51, Introduction to Computer-Aided Machine Design, is a robotics competition between teams of students. In Spring 2017, we had to design a remote-controlled robot that could pick up ping pong balls, carry them up a ramp, and deposit them inside hoops at various heights while also fitting inside a 12" cube. We designed the PewPew3000, design that utilized a flywheel shooter mechanism in order to avoid climbing up the ramp. We were the only team in the competition to use a shooter design. The PewPew3000 was the lightest robot, the fastest robot, the only one capable of climbing the 30Â° ramp. We won second place.
